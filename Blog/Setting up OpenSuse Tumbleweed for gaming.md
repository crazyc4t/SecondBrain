What's up guys! It's me again, and I wanted to cover real quick how to setup OpenSuse Tumbleweed for gaming! Since it's an awesome distro, is the one that I am using right now instead of Arch Linux, because it's more worryless and calm, due to the fact that it has everything that I need with zypper patterns,.

```bash
sudo zypper in steam gamemoded mangohud lutris wine-staging
```
